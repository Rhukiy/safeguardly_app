# Safeguardly

**What it is**  
Safeguardly is a digital safety coordination platform that helps individuals, workplaces, and campuses detect, report, and respond to personal-safety incidents in real time. It unifies mobile alerts, SMS, and dashboards into one ecosystem for faster help and better accountability.

**Why it matters**  
Emergencies are unpredictable, and traditional hotlines are often slow or inaccessible. Safeguardly closes this gap by connecting people directly to trusted contacts, community responders, and verified institutions through automation and geolocation.

**Who it’s for**  
- Everyday users who need instant SOS communication.  
- Organizations that want visibility into safety incidents.  
- Local responders (security, emergency lines) who need structured notifications.

**Key features**  
- One-tap SOS and live-location broadcast.  
- Multi-channel alerts (App push, SMS, and email).  
- Real-time dashboard for responders.  
- Anonymous whistleblowing and escalation workflow.  
- Safety-insight analytics for admins.

**Technologies**  
Frontend: React / React Native · Backend: Node.js + Express · Database: PostgreSQL · Realtime: WebSocket · Notifications: Twilio (SMS) + FCM (push) · Deployment: Docker + Render or AWS.
